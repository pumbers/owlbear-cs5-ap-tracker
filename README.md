# Chivalry & Sorcery 5th Edition Action Points Tracker

Running C&S combat and keeping track of the number of Action Points each character has, and their resulting initiative order, can be tricky. This AP tracker for Owlbear Rodeo 2 automates much of that process and allows GM's & Players to easily manage their character's AP.

See the [Owlbear Rodeo Extensions Store page](public/store.md) for details on how to use the extension.

The extension can be added by following the instructions in the [Owlbear Rodeo Guide](https://extensions.owlbear.rodeo/guide).
